                Despite seeming like a terrible feature on paper, exhaust syngergies form the backbone of many Ironclad runs. Exhausting a card removes it from 
               your deck for the combat, with only a single rare card (which also exhausts) able to bring them back. While this seems terrible on paper, Ironclad 
               has many ways to benifet from exhausting cards. Cards such as Feel No Pain, which give you block for exhausted cards, alongside dark embrace, which
               draws you a card for every exhausted card, can easily carry an exhaust deck to the late game. The card that singlehandidly brings the exhaust strategy
               from good to insane however is Corruption. Corruption makes skills free but exhausts them, allowing you to focus all of your energy on attacking, while 
               getting bonuses from your exhaust syngery powers.

                Although the most basic of stratigies for Ironclad, strength is by no means his weakest. Through powers such as Inflame, which provides a flat buff,
                and Rupture, which allows scaling through self damage, ironclad has many early game options. For later acts, cards such as spot weakness, which allow 
                for multiple strength increases become a priority. Rounding it all of, the Ironclad's "form" card, Demon Form, allows for late game scaling, and 
                can singlehandidly win most boss fights through its turn-by-turn strength gain.

                Searing Blow is very much a make or break card, whose power most depends on when you obtain it (if at all). It is a wholly unique card across all classes,
                being the only card in the game that is able to be upgraded an infinite amount of times. With each upgrade, searing blow's damage increases exponentially,
                reaching potenitally absurd numbers if you start obtain it early enough while focusing all rest sites on upgrading it. Although simple, it is an effective
                strategy, albiet one that requires you to not take any upgrade-hungry cards.
