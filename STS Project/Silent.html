                Perhaps the Silent's most iconic strategy, Shivs serve as the backbone of many of the Silent's early game combats, with much versitality. The most basic 
                cards of the strategy, blade dance alongside cloak and dagger, serve as good offensive and defensive cards that can easily scale in order to still be
                useful in the later game. Most prominently, accuracy, a cheap power, serves as a flat damage boost to all shivs. With a single unupgraded accuracy, the 
                damage of shivs is doubled. Alongside accuracy, there are a great many other relics and cards that synergize with shivs, from relics that proc after 
                multiple attacks, to cards that deal damage based on how many attacks have been played.

            <h2>
                Poison:
            </h2>
        </div>
         <div style="color: rgb(203, 184, 92); width: 53%;">
            <p class="outlined-text">
                A very simple but effective strategy, poison is notable for its ability to go through enemies block, though it can be blocked by artifact and purged
                by certain bosses. Poison stratigies are often slow starters that ramp up to deal insane damage, often with the help of one or more catalysts, which doubles 
                (or upgraded, triples) the posion on an enemy. Through the use of a nightmare (which gives you copies of any card), it is more then possible to 
                go over the integer limit. Alongside the insane single target potential, the silent has some tools to help with AOE fights as well. In terms of relics, 
                there is one that applies 4 poison to all enemies at the start of combat, which can either serve as a useful artifact stripper or ramp up, and one that 
                transfers poison when an enemey is defeated. In terms of cards, corpse explosion deals AOE damage equal to that of a defeated enemy, and noxious fumes 
                applies posion to all enemies every turn.

                Card manipulation:
            </h2>

                One of the silents more complicated stratigies, card manipulation, mainly through card draw and discard, is arguably one of her most consistant synergies.
                The simple act of being able to draw several cards is already one of the strongest abilites in STS, regardless of characters, but the Silent's ability
                to take advantage of card manipulation is what makes her stand out. The silent has several ways to use discard to her advantage as well. With the majority
                of her cards that draw other cards also coming with a discard, she is able to make use of cards that have certain syngergies with discarding, such as 
                unplayable cards that give energy or card draw when discarded, and hard hitting 3 cost attacks that become cheaper when other cards are discarded. The 
                strength of card draw cannot be understated enough, as it allows you to cycle past your weaker cards to your stronger cards more often. With the Silent,
                there is a card that makes card draw even more powerful: Bullet time. Bullet time is a 3 cost skill that makes every card in your hand free, but disables
                card draw of all sorts for the remainder of your turn. With any sort of card draw, this quickly goes from a mediocre skill to an incredibly powerful 
                card that can single handidly win fights.
