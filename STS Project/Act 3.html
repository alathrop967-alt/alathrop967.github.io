                Act 3 (offically known as the The Beyond) is the last act in slay the spire (not including the optional act 4), and has several potential run ending
                 fights. The general strategy for this act is to pick of scaling, such as strength for ironclad, poision or accuracy or silent, focus for defect, and
                 more stance cards for watcher. By this point, you should have removed several of your starter cards through shops and events, as well as at least 4 
                 energy a turn (see the boss relics page). A lack of scaling and/or energy will lead to a long and painful act 3, with an almsot certain loss to any 
                 of the 3 final bosses.

                The Giant head is a very unique enemy, having the most health of any enemy execpt the heart. Alongside this, it shares some similarities with the 
                Lagavulin, having a 4 turn setup period where it deals very little damage, allowing for either setup on the players end, or a headstart on damage. 
                To counteract its massive healthpool, the head starts with a unique debuff; slow. This debuff makes the head recieve 10% more damage for every Card 
                played this turn, making decks that rely on a lot of small cards rather then a few heavy hitting cards deal with the head much easier. After the 4
                turn setup, then head starts doing 45 damage, and gaining 5~ damage each turn until you or the head dies.

                Arguably the strongest non-boss enemy in the game, the Reptomancer can be a run ender for any deck that isnt specifically designed with her in mind, 
                starting off with 2 minions, as well as the ability to summon more. These minions have 20-25 health, and deal low damage but add a wound the first turn
                they are around. The second turn, they do 25-30 damage, add a wound, but die after this big attack. The Reptomancer herself starts off the combat 
                summoning additonal minions, then dealing upwards of 40 damage for the remaining turns. Without any sort of AOE you are bound to take a lot of damage,
                and a lot of block and single target damage is also required, to both block the massive attacks and deal with the large health pool of the Reptomancer.
