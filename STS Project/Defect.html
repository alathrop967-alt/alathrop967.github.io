                The bread and butter of the Defect, focus, or orb based builds, are the backbone to the vast majority of Defect runs. Focus buffs the power of orbs, a 
                feature unique to the Defect. Even a small amount of focus can easily double or triple the power of most orbs, while a large amount (namely from biased
                congnition, a card based around a burst of power that slowly fades) can easily win a fight on its own. With his orbs, defect can deal AOE damage, huge
                burst damage, get passive and burst block, and even generate energy.

            <p class="outlined-text">
                If you dont wish to use orbs, the most effective alternative comes from reprogram, a card that removes focus (putting you in negatives) in exchange for
                strength and dexterity, stats that buff the damage and block of physical cards rather than orbs. With the large amount of 0 cost cards and low block/damage 
                cards that Defect has, reprogram is a very viable alternative to Orbs, though it is all but impossible to shift into if you have speced into any sort
                of orbs, whether it be orb generation or focus.

                Claw is law. Look into any STS discussion anywhere, and you will see this sentiment repeated by almsot everyone. A 0 cost physcial attack, it starts by
                doing 3 damage and increasing the damage of ALL claws in your deck by 2. If you have 1 claw, its terrible, 2, its even worse, but 3 or more and a 
                sufficently small deck or large amount of draw? Say goodbye to the enemies health, because its gone now. With just a few rotations, claws can easily
                become a 0 cost attack that do upwards of 30 damage, while scaling itself and other claw cards. Alongside autucal claw cards, there are several other 
                syngergies, such as all for one, which puts all 0 cost cards in the discard pile into your hand, and scrape, which draws 4 cards and discards all non
                0 cost cards. Alongside those, there is also hologram, which puts any card from your discard into your hand, and rebound, which puts the next card played
                onto the top of your deck.
