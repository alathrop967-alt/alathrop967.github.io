                Act 2 (offically known as the The City) is the second act, and is often seen as the hardest act in the spire. It includes several hard regular hallway 
                fights (such as a fight where one enemy makes you block for less and the other makes you vulnrable), and punishing elite fights. General strategy for 
                this act is to take block cards, as you should have picked up damage cards in Act 1. This is not a hard and fast rule however, as additonal damage
                or scaling can also be useful for act 2. 
            </p>

            <p style="width: 40%;" class="outlined-text">
                The Book of stabbing is an enemy that has hard hitting multiattacks most turns, while adding wounds to your deck if you cannot block its attacks fully.
                Because of its reliance on multiattacks, any source of removing strength (disarm for ironclad, malaise for silent) can easily trivialze this fight, 
                allowing for a much easier time. However, as its attacks deal more damage every turn, and it has big hitting single attacks, it is still a deadly elite,
                even with a source or two of removing strength. The general stratgey of bursting down elites is also incredibly important here, as it can quickly start
                doing over 40 damage turn if not taken care of.
            </p>
            <p style="width: 40%;" class="outlined-text">
                The Gremlin leader is another multi fight, though different from the sentries and slavers. The fight starts with three enemies, 2 random gremlins and 
                the Gremlin Leader. The auctual Grelmin leader itself has three three different moves it can do, based off how many gremlins are on the field. If you have 
                not killed any gremlins the first turn, it will do a big attack on turn 2; if you have, it will summon 2 additonal gremlins (for a max of 4). Alongside 
                its summon and big attack, it can also buff the strength of gremlins and itself. Through targeting gremlins, you can manipulate the leaders patterns to 
                a certain extent, allowing for turns where you can focus entierlly on damage as he chooses to summon or buff rather then attack.
            </p>
            <p style="width: 40%;" class="outlined-text">
                Lastly, and frequently most deadly, the three slavers attack every turn (with one exepction), leading to massive incoming damage on every turn, making 
                it a nesseccity to burst one down quickly. In regards to this, the red slaver (on the right) is the one that should be targetted first, as it applies
                 vulnrable, as well making you unable to play any attacks one the fourth or fifth turn. Alongside this, the blue slaver applies weak, and the Taskmaster
                 puts wounds in your deck, leading to dead draws as well as lessened damage as the fight goes on.
